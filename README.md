# Memories 
## Cross-Device Web Project

This project explores the possibilities of creative cross-device applications. 

In a fictitious art exhibition on the theme of memories, visitors have the opportunity to create a soap bubble with a personal memory. A photo can be selected and then be sent out to the wide world by blowing into the microphone of the mobile device. The world is represented by a large projection in the exhibition, where all the bubbles of different visitors are floating around.

The project was created during the course *Studio Web & Mobile Design 2* in the Digital Ideation studies at Lucerne University of Applied Science and Arts HSLU.
